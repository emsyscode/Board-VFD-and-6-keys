# Board-VFD-and-6-keys
This is a code to run over Arduino to control a driver VFD model 16312 and use a interrupt to generate a 0.5 secs pulse.
This is only a model, the code is not clean and is not perfect, this is only a total and independent model of code.
Don't make recurse at special librarys wich means wich I'm release all code.
The board I'm use is present almost all cheap DVD Players and you can adapte the code to a counter, clock or cronometer.
